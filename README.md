Algorithmic and Networking Projects | C++ & Python

This repository gathers small, independent projects implemented in C++ and Python, originally developed as university assignments to practice fundamental concepts in algorithms and networking.  
The goal is to gain hands-on experience with error detection, network protocols, encryption, and client-server communication through practical, assignment-based examples.

🛠️ Included Projects

CRCVerifier: Checks if a binary message complies with the CRC generator polynomial and calculates the complete CRC code (message + remainder). | C++ |

ParityChecker: Creates a two-dimensional parity bit matrix for detecting and locating errors in a binary message. Allows simulating a corrupted bit and identifying it. | C++ |

Token Ring Sim: Simulates the circulation of a token in a ring network. Messages are sent from source to destination with configurable direction and highlighted token path. | C++ |

Sliding Window Sim: Simulates the Sliding Window protocol for packet transmission, handling random losses and retransmissions until all packets are successfully acknowledged. | C++ |

Client-Server Crypto: Client-server application that encrypts and decrypts messages using transposition cipher. The server sends the key and encrypted message to the client, which decrypts and displays it. | Python |
